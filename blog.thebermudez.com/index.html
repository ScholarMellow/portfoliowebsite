		<h1>This Is My First Article</h1>


			<p class="firstParagraph">I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. In life you need colors. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud.</p>

			<p>In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun</p>

			<p>A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day.</p>

			<p class="secondParagraph">I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. All kinds of happy little splashes.</p>

			<p>Imagination is the key to painting. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Maybe there's a little something happening right here.</p>

			<p>Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. The least little bit can do so much. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Let's build an almighty mountain.</p>

			<p>You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. You can do it.</p>

			<p>Use what you see, don't plan it. We don't have anything but happy trees here. In your world you have total and absolute power. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Brown is such a nice color.

			<p>The light is your friend. Preserve it. We'll play with clouds today. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring.</p>

			<p>That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. You can create anything that makes you happy. And just raise cain. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy.</p>

			<p>I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. We have a fantastic little sky! Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do.</p>

			<p>Here's something that's fun. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Let's get crazy. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy.</p>
