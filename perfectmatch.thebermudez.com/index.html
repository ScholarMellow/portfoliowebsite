<p>Every day I learn. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend.

If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.

Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. See there, told you that would be easy. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner.

A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Be brave. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. We'll paint one happy little tree right here.

You are only limited by your imagination. You can spend all day playing with mountains. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. There are no limits in this world.

Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.

That's a son of a gun of a cloud. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces.</p>
